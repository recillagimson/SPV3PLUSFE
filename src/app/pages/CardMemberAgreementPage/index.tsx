              Squid provides a customer loyalty platform which rewards Users
              with Squid Points whenever they purchase goods and services from
              participating Merchants. Users can use these Squid Points in their
              next purchases, or in purchasing goods and services from other
              participating Merchants.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Squid Points in the account of each User increase with every
              purchase made. Users may also increase their Squid Points by
              buying Squid Scratchcards and loading up their accounts through
              other payment schemes.

              User may become a registered member (<strong>“Member”</strong>) by
              entering into a membership agreement with Squid or other relevant
              agreements of Squid from time to time. Members are limited to one
              free account per person or business entity. Your Squid account is
              solely for your own personal use and benefit. Notwithstanding the
              above, you acknowledge that Squid reserves the right to charge for
              any portion of the Squid Services and to change its fees (if any)
              from time to time in its sole discretion.
            </p>

            <p>
              You are solely responsible for your interactions with other
              Members. Squid reserves the right, but has no obligation, to
              resolve or arbitrate disputes between you and other Members,
              including, but not limited to, the suspension or termination of
              the account of either or both Members.
            </p>

            <h6>5.2 Authorized Users</h6>

            <p>
              You may designate persons to act as your agents to use the
              Services, provided that each designated person has the legal
              capacity to enter into binding contracts or you. Furthermore, you
              represent and warrant that each person who registers under your
              account is your authorized agent (an “Authorized User”) who has
              such legal capacity.
            </p>

            <h6>5.3 Responsibility for Access</h6>

            <p>
              You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
              your access information (i.e., account IDs and passwords) and for
              restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept
              responsibility for all activities, actions, incidents, and damages
              that occur under your account or password.
            </p>

            <h6>5.4 Notification of Unauthorized Use</h6>

            <p>
              If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer
              secure (e.g., in the event of a loss, theft, or unauthorized
              disclosure or use of your account ID, password, or any credit,
              debit, or charge card number, if applicable), then you agree to
              immediately notify Squid.
            </p>

            <h6>5.5 Identity Authentication</h6>

            <p>
              You authorize Squid, directly or through third parties, to make
              any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity.
              This may include asking you for further information, requiring you
              to provide your date of birth, a taxpayer identification number,
              and other information that will allow us to reasonably identify
              you, requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your
              email address or financial instruments, ordering a credit report,
              or verifying your Information against third party databases or
              through other sources. We may also ask to see your driver’s
              license or other identifying documents at any time. Squid reserves
              the right to close, suspend, or limit access to your account
              and/or the Squid Services in the event we are unable to obtain or
              verify these information.

            <h5>Squid’s Intellectual Property Policy</h5>

            <p>
              Squid respects artist and content owner rights. Thus, it is
              Squid’s policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement.
              Squid will promptly terminate without notice any User’s access to
              the Services if that User is determined in the sole discretion of
              Squid to be a “repeat infringer.” For purposes of this provision,
              a repeat infringer is a User who has been notified by Squid of
              infringing activity violations more than twice.
            </p>

            <p>
              You agree not to use the Squid site or the Services to transmit,
              route, provide connections to, or store any material that
              infringes copyrighted works or otherwise violates or promotes the
              violation of the intellectual property rights of any third party.

              (d) NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY
              YOU FROM US OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY

            <p>
              (e) SQUID SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
              CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF SQUID, ITS
              SUPPLIERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES AND
              SHAREHOLDERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

            <p>
              Some jurisdictions do not allow for the exclusion of certain
              warranties or conditions or the limitation or exclusion of
              liability for loss or damage caused by negligence, breach of
              contract or breach of implied terms, or incidental or
              consequential damages, so the limitations or exclusions of
              liability in this Agreement above may not apply to you.

              intangible losses (even if we have been advised of the possibility
              of such damages), resulting from: (a) the use or the inability to
              use the Services; (b) the cost of procurement of substitute goods
              and services resulting from any goods, data, information, or
              services purchased or obtained or messages received or
              transactions entered into through or from the Services; (c)
              unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or

            <p>
              We reserve the right to change this Agreement at any time without
              notice. We also reserve the right at any time to modify or
              discontinue the Services, temporarily or permanently, with or
              without notice to you. You agree that we shall not be liable to

              discontinuance of the Services. Further, you acknowledge that
              Squid may change applicable subscription fees in Schedule “A” at

            <p>
              Without prejudice to other remedies which Squid may have, Squid
              may immediately issue a warning, suspend (i.e., lock out access
              and operation of Services for User) or restrict either temporarily
              or indefinitely, or terminate User’s account and refuse to provide
              Services to User if: (a) Squid believes that User has violated or
              acted inconsistently with this Agreement, or any of our policies;
              or (b) User has failed to pay fees or other payments due to Squid;
              or (c) Squid is unable to verify or authenticate any information
              User provides to Squid; or (d) Squid believes that User’s actions
              may cause legal liability for User, Squid’s other clients, or
              Squid.
            </p>

            <p>
              Squid may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue
              providing the Services, or any part thereof, with or without
              notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the
              Services under any provision of these terms and conditions may be
              effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that
              Squid may immediately deactivate, archive, or delete your account
              and all related information and data and/or any further access to
              such data or the Service. Further, you agree that Squid shall not
              be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your
              access to the Services.

            <p>
              Our website(s) may provide hyperlinks to third party websites or

              environment, you should use your best judgment and exercise
              caution where appropriate. You further agree that Squid shall not

            <h5>Arbitration</h5>

            <p>
              YOU AND Squid AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS MAY OTHERWISE BE PROVIDED IN
              REGARD TO SPECIFIC SERVICES ON THE SITE IN ANY SPECIFIC TERMS
              APPLICABLE TO THOSE SERVICES, OR UPON REQUEST BY Squid FOR
              RESOLUTION AT ANY OTHER FORUM AT Squid’S SOLE DISCRETION, THE SOLE
              AND EXCLUSIVE FORUM AND REMEDY FOR ANY AND ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS
              RELATING IN ANY WAY TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE SITE,
              AND/OR THE SERVICE (INCLUDING YOUR VISIT TO OR USE OF THE SITE
              AND/OR THE SERVICE) SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, except
              that to the extent that either of us has in any manner infringed
              upon or violated or threatened to infringe upon or violate the
              other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret
              rights, or you have otherwise violated any of the user policy or
              conduct rules set forth above then the parties acknowledge that
              arbitration is not an adequate remedy at law and that injunctive
              or other appropriate relief may be sought. Arbitration under this
              Agreement shall be conducted by the Hong Kong International
              Arbitration Centre. The language of the arbitration shall be
              English. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding and may be
              entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To
              the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and except as
              otherwise approved by Squid, NO ARBITRATION OR CLAIM UNDER THESE
              TERMS OF USE SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM,
              INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR
              FORMER USER OF THE SERVICE, AND NO className ARBITRATION
              PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED.

            <h5>Miscellaneous</h5>

            <p>
              These terms and conditions will be governed by and construed in
              accordance with the laws of the Philippines, excluding that body
              of law governing conflict of laws. Any legal action or proceeding
              not subject to arbitration, relating to or arising out of these
              Terms or your use of our websites will be brought in the proper
              courts in Makati City, and you submit to the venue and personal
              jurisdiction of such court and waive all defences of lack of
              personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to
              venue and jurisdiction in Makati City. If any provision of this
              Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision
              will be enforced to the greatest extent possible and the remaining
              provisions will remain in full force and effect. Headings are for
              reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe, or
              describe the scope or extent of such section. Squid’s failure to
              act with respect to a breach by User or others does not waive
              Squid’s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar
              breaches. No action by User arising under this Agreement may be
              brought at any time more than twelve (12) months after the facts
              occurred upon which the cause of action arose.
            </p>

            <h6>15.1 Assignment</h6>

            <p>
              User may not assign any of its rights, or delegate any of its
              duties under this Agreement, and any attempted assignment will be
              null and void. Squid may assign any of its rights or obligations
              without notice and/or restriction.
            </p>

            <h6>15.2 Force Majeure</h6>

            <p>
              Operation of our Services may be interfered with by numerous
              factors outside of our control and we shall not be liable to you
              for any delay or failure in performance under this Agreement
              resulting directly or indirectly from causes beyond Squid’s
              control.
            </p>

            <h6>15.3 Interpretation</h6>

            <p>
              If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
              unenforceable, such provision shall be struck out, as narrowly as
              possible, and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. Headings
              are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit,
              construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. This
              Agreement is prepared and executed in the English language. The
              English language version shall govern the parties’ relationship.
              Any translation of this Agreement into other languages shall be
              for informational purposes and shall have no legal effect.
            </p>

            <h6>15.4 Squid Confidential Information</h6>

            <p>
              You represent and warrant to Squid that (a) you are not a
              competitor of Squid, (b) you shall keep publicly unannounced
              information and materials pertaining to Squid, pre-release
              software, testing or testing procedures strictly confidential, and
              (c) you shall not use any information gained from access to the
              Squid websites or use of the Squid Services to compete with Squid
              in its business.
            </p>

            <h6>15.5 Entire Agreement</h6>

            <p>
              Except for other agreements or terms appearing on our websites,

              between us with respect to the subject matter hereof.
